We are hoping to engage citizen scientists and other researchers to help us with our 
research. We will use this repo to post issues containing questions and problems that 
we need help with or that we are thinking about but do not have resources to pursue. 

Overall, we would love to engage with people from the communities related to any of the 
research we are doing: mental health, neurological disorders, neuroscience, informatics, 
machine learning, and speech and other communication disorders.

Please feel welcome to comment on any issue. We will be glad to coordinate any effort.

The `tutorials` directory will contain miscellaneous notebooks as we or others work on 
problems. If solving one of our questions requires creating a notebook, please consider
sending a PR to the repo.
